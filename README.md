# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA_ANALYSIS
I completed a Company Financials Data Analysis project in collaboration with UNP using a company financial dataset in Microsoft Power BI. The project involved importing, cleaning, and transforming raw data related to products, countries, customer segments, discounts, costs, and profits. I created multiple DAX measures such as Total Sales, Total Cost, Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Average Manufacturing Cost to derive meaningful insights from the data. An interactive dashboard was designed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and comparative visualizations. The dashboards highlighted product-wise sales volume, profit contribution, country-wise revenue distribution, segment performance, and the impact of discount strategies on profitability. Dynamic slicers were implemented to allow users to filter data by product, country, segment, and time period. Through this project, I developed strong skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, financial analysis, and data visualization. The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by providing a clear and concise overview of the company’s financial performance.
